# üß† Stress Level Classifier with CNN

This project is a stress level detection system based on **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using TensorFlow.  
The model is trained to recognize facial expressions and map them into different stress levels.

## üöÄ How to Run the Program

### üîß To Train the Model:
```bash
python3 -m src.training
```
*(Training automatically triggers evaluation after completion.)*

### üß™ To Test the Model:
- Using OpenCV only:
```bash
python3 -m src.modelTest
```
- Using Mediapipe:
```bash
python3 -m src.modelTestMediapipe
```

### üìä To Visualize Training Statistics (Accuracy & Loss):
```bash
python3 -m src.visualData
```

## üß† Model Algorithm Overview

The model uses a CNN-based architecture enhanced with residual blocks to classify facial expressions. Here's a high-level summary:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Grayscale images resized to **48x48** or **64x64** pixels (configurable).
   - Combines original and augmented data using `ImageDataGenerator` for improved generalization.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Initial Conv2D layer with batch normalization and max pooling.
   - Four stacked **residual blocks** with increasing filter sizes: 64, 128, 256, 512.
   - Global average pooling followed by dense layers, LeakyReLU activation, and softmax output.

3. **Training Configuration**:
   - Optimizer: Adam (`learning_rate=1e-4`)
   - Loss function: Categorical Crossentropy with label smoothing
   - Callbacks used:
     - `EarlyStopping`: Stops training if validation loss doesn't improve for 10 epochs
     - `ReduceLROnPlateau`: Reduces learning rate if validation loss plateaus for 5 epochs
     - `ModelCheckpoint`: Saves the best model based on validation loss
     - `CSVLogger`: Logs training history into timestamped CSV files

4. **Evaluation & Results**:
   - After training, the model is immediately evaluated.
   - Confusion matrix and classification report are automatically generated.
   - Outputs are saved inside the `logs/` folder.

5. **Model Output**:
   - Last trained model: `models/finalModel.h5`
   - Best validation model: `models/bestModel.h5`
